# PuppetDB documentation

If you were redirected while trying to reach the PuppetDB docs at puppet.com/docs/puppetdb, the version you were trying to reach is no longer maintained.

For the most recent PuppetDB docs, see [puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest](). For a list of the current maintained versions of open source Puppet and its components, see the most recent [Puppet version](puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/about_agent.html) information. For a list of supported Puppet Enterprise versions, see the [Puppet Enterprise lifecycle](https://puppet.com/misc/puppet-enterprise-lifecycle).

If you need docs for an older version of PuppetDB, you may be able to find it by switching to the relevant branch of this repository.
